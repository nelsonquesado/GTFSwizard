\title{Delay Specified Trips in a `wizardgtfs` Object}
\usage{
delay_trip(gtfs, trip, duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{An object representing GTFS data, preferably of class `wizardgtfs`.}

\item{trip}{A character vector of `trip_id`s in the `wizardgtfs` object that will be delayed. Each `trip_id` must exist in `gtfs$trips$trip_id`.}

\item{duration}{A delay duration, either as a `duration` object or a numeric value representing seconds.}
}
\value{
A modified `wizardgtfs` object with updated arrival and departure times for the specified trips.
}
\description{
This function adds a delay to the arrival and departure times of specified trips within a `wizardgtfs` object.
If the input GTFS object is not of class `wizardgtfs`, it will be converted.
}
\details{
This function adjusts the arrival and departure times of the specified `trip_id`s in `gtfs$stop_times` by the specified `duration`.
If `gtfs` is not a `wizardgtfs` object, the function will attempt to convert it using `GTFSwizard::as_wizardgtfs()`, and a warning will be issued.
The function checks that `trip` contains valid `trip_id`s and that `duration` is either a `duration` or numeric (seconds).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Delay trips by 5 minutes
gtfs <- delay_trip(gtfs = for_gtfs, for_gtfs$trips$trip_id[1:2], duration = 300)

# Delay trips by duration
gtfs <- delay_trip(gtfs = for_gtfs,
                    trip = for_gtfs$trips$trip_id[1],
                    duration = lubridate::duration(10, "minutes"))
 }
