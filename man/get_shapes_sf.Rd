\title{Convert GTFS Shapes Table to Simple Features (sf) Format}
\usage{
get_shapes_sf(gtfs)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object containing the `shapes` table or the shape table itself. If the `shapes` table is missing, it will be created using `get_shapes()`.}
}
\value{
An `sf` object with shapes as `LINESTRING` geometries:
}
\description{
`get_shapes_sf` converts the shapes table in a `wizardgtfs` object into a simple features (`sf`) object, making it suitable for spatial analysis. This function checks and processes the `shapes` data in the provided GTFS object and structures it as `LINESTRING` features.
}
\details{
- When the input `wizardgtfs` object lacks a `shapes` table, the function automatically generates one using `get_shapes()`.

- The `shapes` table in the GTFS object are transformed into `LINESTRING` geometries. If `shape_pt_sequence` is absent, the points are treated as ordered by their position in the data.

- If `shape_dist_traveled` is available, cumulative distance calculations are included for each shape point.
}
\note{
If `shape_pt_sequence` is missing, the function will assume that points are ordered, constructing the shape accordingly.
