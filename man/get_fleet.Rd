\title{Estimates Fleet from GTFS Data}
\usage{
get_fleet(gtfs, method = "by.route")
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object, ideally of class `wizardgtfs`. If not, it will be converted.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the calculation method. Options include:
\describe{
  \item{"by.route"}{Calculates the maximum number of simultaneous trips for each route.}
  \item{"by.hour"}{Calculates the maximum number of simultaneous trips by hour of the day across all routes.}
  \item{"peak"}{Calculates the maximum number of simultaneous trips for the three busiest hours.}
  \item{"detailed"}{Calculates the maximum number of simultaneous trips across each timepoint within a trip.}
}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the fleet based on the specified method:
  \describe{
    \item{If `method = "by.route"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `route_id`, `fleet`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency`.}
    \item{If `method = "by.hour"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `hour`, `fleet`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency`.}
    \item{If `method = "peak"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `hour`, `fleet`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency` for the busiest three hours.}
    \item{If `method = "detailed"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `route_id`, `net.fleet`, `fleet`, `time`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency` for each timepoint.}
  }
}
\description{
The `get_fleet` function estimates the fleet from a `wizardgtfs` object using different methods. Depending on the selected `method`, it can estimates fleet by route, by hour, peak times, or detailed timepoints.
}
\details{
This function calls specific sub-functions based on the selected method:

- "by.route": Calculates the maximum simultaneous trips per route.

- "by.hour": Calculates the maximum simultaneous trips for each hour of the day.

- "peak": Calculates the maximum simultaneous trips for the three busiest hours.

- "detailed": Provides a timepoint-based fleet calculation, showing detailed fleet fluctutations over the course of the trip.

If an invalid `method` is specified, the function defaults to `"by.route"` and provides a warning.

\examples{
# Calculate fleet requirements by route
fleet_by_route <- get_fleet(gtfs = for_gtfs, method = "by.route")

# Calculate fleet requirements by hour
fleet_by_hour <- get_fleet(gtfs = for_gtfs, method = "by.hour")

# Calculate fleet requirements for peak hours
fleet_peak <- get_fleet(gtfs = for_gtfs, method = "peak")

# Calculate detailed fleet requirements over timepoints
fleet_detailed <- get_fleet(gtfs = for_gtfs, method = "detailed")
