\title{Plot Trip Frequency Calendar for GTFS Data}
\usage{
plot_calendar(gtfs, ncol = 6, facet_by_year = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object, ideally of class `wizardgtfs`. If not, it will be converted.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for monthly faceting. Ignored if `facet_by_year = TRUE`.}

\item{facet_by_year}{Logical value. If `TRUE`, plots data by year with each month in a separate column.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object showing a calendar heatmap of the daily trip counts across the specified GTFS date range.
}
\description{
`plot_calendar` creates a calendar heatmap visualization of the number of trips in a GTFS dataset for each day, with options for monthly and yearly faceting.
}
\details{
- The function calculates daily trip frequencies from the `service_id` and `dates_services` tables in the GTFS object.

- Days with no trips are marked in black, while other days are shaded on a gradient from pink (low trip count) to red (high trip count).

- If `facet_by_year = TRUE`, the plot will display each year in separate rows, and `ncol` is automatically set to zero.
}
\examples{
# Plot a GTFS trip calendar with 4 columns
plot_calendar(for_gtfs, ncol = 4)

# Plot a GTFS trip calendar, faceting by year
plot_calendar(for_gtfs, facet_by_year = TRUE)
