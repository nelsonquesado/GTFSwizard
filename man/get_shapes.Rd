\title{Generate Shapes Table for GTFS Data}
\usage{
get_shapes(gtfs)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object, ideally of class `wizardgtfs`. If not, it will be converted automatically.}
}
\value{
A modified GTFS object that includes a `shapes` table derived from the stops and trips information.
}
\description{
The `get_shapes` function reconstructs the `shapes` table for a GTFS dataset using an approximation based on stop coordinates and sequence information. It creates geometric representations of trips by connecting stops in sequence for each trip.
}
\details{
This function constructs the `shapes` table by sequentially connecting stops along each trip using a Euclidean approximation. If the GTFS object already contains a `shapes` table, it will be overwritten, and a warning will be displayed. The process involves:

- Selecting and arranging stops by trip and sequence

- Connecting stops with line segments to form a path for each trip

- Grouping unique paths into distinct shape IDs
}
\note{
This approximation may not perfectly represent real-world shapes, especially for complex or curved routes.
`get_shapes()` uses stop sequences to recriate the shapes table; accordingly, should not be used after `filter_time()`, as this function removes invalid `stop_times`.
