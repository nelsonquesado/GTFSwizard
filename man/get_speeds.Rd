\title{Calculate Speeds for GTFS Routes and Trips}
\usage{
get_speeds(gtfs, method = "by.route")
}
\arguments{
\item{gtfs}{A GTFS object, ideally of class `wizardgtfs`. If the `shapes` table is missing, it will be created automatically using `get_shapes()`.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the calculation method. Options include:
\describe{
  \item{"by.route"}{Calculates the average speed for each route based on average distance and duration.}
  \item{"by.trip"}{Calculates the average speed for each trip based on total distance and duration.}
  \item{"detailed"}{Calculates the speed for each segment between stops within a trip.}
}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing speed calculations, depending on the specified method:
  \describe{
    \item{If `method = "by.route"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `route_id`, `trips`, `average.speed`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency`.}
    \item{If `method = "by.trip"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `route_id`, `trip_id`, `average.speed`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency`.}
    \item{If `method = "detailed"`}{Returns a data frame with columns: `route_id`, `trip_id`, `hour`, `from_stop_id`, `to_stop_id`, `speed`, `service_pattern`, and `pattern_frequency`.}
  }
}
\description{
`get_speeds` calculates the average speed of trips and routes within a `wizardgtfs` object. It uses distance and duration to provide speed outputs based on the specified `method`.
}
\details{
- This function calls specific sub-functions based on the selected `method`:
  \describe{
    \item{`by.route`}{Calculates average speed across each route.}
    \item{`by.trip`}{Calculates average speed across each trip.}
    \item{`detailed`}{Calculates speeds between consecutive stops within each trip.}
  }

- If an invalid `method` is specified, the function defaults to `"by.route"` and provides a warning.
